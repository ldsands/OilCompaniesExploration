uv run streamlit run src/app.py
# if using on a computer for the first time install uv then use the command below
uv sync
```

- initial setup

    - As if 2024-08-30 if you have a `pyproject.toml` streamlit cloud assumes it is a poetry project

```sh
# create a requirements.txt file for streamlit cloud to use
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
